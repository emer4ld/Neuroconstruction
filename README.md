What I need to have: Reading mouse pointer position on some two-dimensional size-limited plane inside some web element as fast as possible. (e.g. each 0,05s or faster)

For example: alike here http://aim400kg.ru/train/?a=fa with difference that I don't want to make it on flash and I need to get whole the mouse motion trajectory so I need to read mouse pointer's position really fast in plane axes.

Technologies I want to use (one of them): ASP.NET or Silverlight

I understand that mouse position reading is client side so there must be something with client orientation: javascript or silverlight on top level, and how to realize the plane is yet another big question for me. After reading trajectory from client side I need to pull it to server (.NET) side for processing.

The question is: The method how to read mouse position on some kind of web frame on javascript or silverlight realization.

All the suggestions are very welcome.
